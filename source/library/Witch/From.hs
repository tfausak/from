-- | This type class is for converting values from some @source@ type into
-- some other @target@ type. The constraint @'From' source target@ means that
-- you can convert from a value of type @source@ into a value of type
-- @target@.
--
-- This type class is for conversions that always succeed. If your conversion
-- sometimes fails, consider implementing @TryFrom@ instead.
class From source target where
  -- | This method implements the conversion of a value between types. At call
  -- sites you may prefer to use @into@ instead.

  -- > -- Avoid this:
  -- > from (x :: s)

  -- The default implementation of this method simply calls 'Coerce.coerce',
  -- which works for types that have the same runtime representation. This
  -- means that for @newtype@s you do not need to implement this method at
  -- all. For example:
  --
  -- >>> newtype Name = Name String
  -- >>> instance From Name String
  -- >>> instance From String Name
